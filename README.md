# cseuoi-diplomathesis

This is an **unofficial** XeLaTeX template for Diploma theses to be authored by undergraduate students at
the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.uoi.gr), [School of Engineering](https://engineering.uoi.gr/), 
[University of Ioannina](https://www.uoi.gr/), in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Diploma of Engineering degree. 


## Modification Notes
 * This template is based on the [official template for Master's theses and Ph.D. dissertations](https://github.com/vvdimako/cseuoi-thesis) used at the same department.
 * Initial modifications made by [George Z. Zachos](ct) on January 2021.


## Sample PDF files
 * [Sample thesis in Greek](SampleThesis-GR.pdf)
 * [Sample thesis in English](SampleThesis-EN.pdf)

## Software Installation

### TeX
In order to use this template, you must first install a TeX distribution.
For example, you can install [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) on Debian-based distributions using the command ```sudo apt-get install texlive-full```.

### TeX Editor
Then, install [Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) using ```sudo apt-get install texmaker```,
or another TeX editor of your choice (i.e. [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/), [Kile](https://apps.kde.org/en/kile)).

## Bibliography
Î¤he `BibTeX` system is used for bibliography management. Bibliography entries are kept in a separate (`.bib`) file and are then imported into the main document.
The following two commands are used to set the style and the external file containing bibliography entries:

```
\bibliographystyle{stylename}
\bibliography{bibfile}
```
In this template, `bibfile` is set to `Content/Bibliography` (Note that there is no file extension) and `stylename` is set to `ieeetran`.
You can use the bibliography style of your choice, but in order to use `ieeetran` you should visit [ieee.org](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html),
download "LaTeX Bibliography Files" ZIP file, extract it and place the `IEEEtran.bst` file in the same directory as `SampleThesis.tex`.


## Compilation
Open the [`Template/SampleThesis.tex`](Template/SampleThesis.tex) file with your TeX editor and compile it with XeLaTeX.
In case the bibliography page is not created compile with `XeLaTeX`, then `BibTeX` and finally `XeLaTeX` (may require two `XeLaTeX` compilations at the end).


## Fonts
For the main text, the freely available *GFS Didot* fonts are required (most probably, they are already installed with TeX Live).
The typewritter font is *Ubuntu Mono* can be found here [`Template/Font`](Template/Font), in case it is not already installed on your system.


## Other Notes
 * The template enables typesetting of Diploma theses in Greek by using the [xgreek](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/xgreek?lang=en) package.
